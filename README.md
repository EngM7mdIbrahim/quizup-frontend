# QuizUp

**Tech Used:** ReactJS, Express, Node, MongoDB

**About:** 

This is a front-end app with customized backend written using the Express framework and NodeJS. QuizUP is an application that can be used by presenters so that they 
can make their sessions interactive. Presenter can log in, create a quiz template by using multiple question types such as true/ false or MCQ and he can chose one of 
his templates to start a live session for the students. The presenter's screen will be shared to the audience so in that case they can scan the QR Code of the session's 
link or even enter the game pin. Once the presenter starts the session, he can control the audience's view live to let them submit their answers to the questions
screen projected on front of them. When the audience are submitting the answers, there are some statistics are updated on the presenter's view. Once the live session is 
done, there is a dashboard showing the audience their rankings among with their dashboard and this can be considered as a a report for this session that can be viewed by
the presenter later.
